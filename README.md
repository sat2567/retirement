## Financial Formulas Implemented

### Growing Annuity (Inflation-Adjusted Withdrawals)
```
PV = PMT Ã— [(1 - ((1+g)/(1+r))^n) / (r - g)]
```
Where:
- PV = Present Value (starting corpus)
- PMT = Payment (monthly withdrawal)
- r = monthly return rate
- g = monthly inflation rate
- n = number of periods

### Future Value with Step-up SIP
```
FV = Î£(SIP_i Ã— (1 + r)^(n-i))
```
Where SIP amounts increase annually by step-up percentage.

### Rate Conversions
Annual rates are converted to monthly using:
```
monthly_rate = (1 + annual_rate/100)^(1/12) - 1
```

## CSV Format for Custom Cashflow

Create a CSV file with a single column named "Cashflow":
```csv
Cashflow
50000
-30000
25000
60000
-40000
```

- Positive values = Money coming in (investments, income)
- Negative values = Money going out (expenses, withdrawals)

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for calculations and data manipulation
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for improved UI/UX
